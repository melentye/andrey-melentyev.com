Summary: Welcome, stranger!

Let me start by introducing myself: my name is Andrey, I am a software engineer with an interest in machine learning.
I plan to blog mostly about how software engineering and machine learning co-exist together, while occasionally taking
a detour into pure programming and perhaps other topics.

### Some facts about me

* I work on real-time credit risk assessment and fraud detection systems at [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/).
* There's usually an online course *or two* I am taking, could in SWE, ML or related areas.
* Born and raised in St. Petersburg, Russia, I now live in Stockholm, Sweden with my lovely wife Elvira.
* I am not necessarily an expert in many things I will blog about, rather a learner hoping to get better by writing.

There's a full-blown narcissistic article [about me]({filename}/pages/about.md)

### Tech stack

It would be unfair not to mention some of the technologies used to create this site.

* It is a static website with [open source code](https://github.com/melentye/andrey-melentyev.com/).
* [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) is used for generating HTML from [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
* AWS S3-backed CloudFront infrastructure is
  [defined as code](https://github.com/melentye/andrey-melentyev.com/tree/master/cloudformation/) using CloudFormation.
* [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is used to automate testing and deployment tasks.
  I plan of course to have a continuous deployment pipeline, but for an MVP with an estimated audience of one person
  including the author, perhaps that would be an overkill.
* It features an ascetic visual design inspired by [the motherfuckingwebsite.com](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).

Thanks and hope you will find the content useful!
