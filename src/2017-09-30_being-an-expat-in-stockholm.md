Summary: Some observations on my move to Stockholm, Sweden

# Being an expat in Stockholm, Sweden

Though I'd document some of the things I found different or surprising after moving to Stockholm in May 2015.

## Getting a work permit

If you are not a EU citizen, in order to move to Sweden for work you need to obtain a permit, the process is
well-described [here](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed.html)
It is surprisingly simple and not demanding from the employee perspective, majority of the paperwork is solved by
Human Entrance, a consultant company that Klarna hires to help with the relocation. The total time between signing
the contract and getting the work permit varies, in our case it was something between 1 and 2 months.

## First impressions

Stockholm is the capital of the country and it feels like it too: the city is rich with museums, theatres, parks and
historical sights. We moved in May and the city is absolutely gorgeous this time of year, some trees and flowers start
to bloom and you get the feeling of spring.

## People

Swedes [speak good English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Europe#English_as_lingua_franca), so
language is not a barrier when moving. They are friendly to expats, I have never seen explicit negativity towards
immigrants. Stockholm is an international city where you'll hear a dozen languages just walking on the street.

## Sports

Almost everyone goes to gym or does something else, could be running,  climbing, fencing, sailing or anything. There
are a few gym chains like SATS and Actic and some standalone gyms too. If you are into outdoors training, some areas
have outdoors gyms. And there are many hiking trails around Stockholm and its suburbs. The whole country is also

## Klarna's benefits

Apart from the stuff that is publicly mentioned everywhere like a mobile phone and a laptop you get
[Safari Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) subscription which has a huge collection of books and courses.

## Weather

If you're moving from a place with bad climate like my hometown, Stockholm could actually be an upgrade. It gets

## Quality of life

### Cashless society

### Electronic everything

### Public transport

### Post

Post is somewhat of a surprising thing to mention when it comes to the quality of life, this is one of those things
you normally don't pay attention to when it works. Well, it doesn't work in Russia where it's not uncommon for the
packages to be lost or to take forever to be delivered, usually by the time you get  a package, you no longer remember
what you've ordered. In Stockholm the post on average works really well. The postal service receives a lot of
criticism these days.

### Food

## Housing

**Ouch!**
