Summary: Some observations on my move to Stockholm, Sweden

# Being an expat in Stockholm, Sweden

Though I'd document some of the things I found different or surprising after moving to Stockholm in May 2015.

## Getting a work permit

If you are not a EU citizen, in order to move to Sweden for work you need to obtain a permit, the process is
well-described [here](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Working-in-Sweden/Employed.html)
It is surprisingly simple and not demanding from the employee perspective, majority of the paperwork is solved by
Human Entrance, a consultant company that Klarna hires to help with the relocation. The total time between signing
the contract and getting the work permit varies, in our case it was something between 1 and 2 months.

## First impressions

Stockholm is the capital of the country and it shows: the city is rich with museums, theatres, parks and
historical sights. We moved in May and the city is absolutely gorgeous this time of year, some trees and flowers start
to bloom and you get the reassuring feeling of spring.

## People

Swedes [speak good English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Europe#English_as_lingua_franca), so
language is not a barrier when moving. They are friendly to expats, I have never experienced explicit negativity
towards immigrants.
Stockholm is an international city where you'll hear a dozen languages just walking on the street.

## Sports

Almost everyone goes to gym or does something else, could be running, climbing, fencing, sailing or anything. There
are a few gym chains like SATS and Actic and some standalone gyms too. If you are into outdoors training, some areas
have outdoors gyms. And there are many hiking trails around Stockholm and its suburbs. The whole country is also
[listed on Airbnb](https://sweden.withairbnb.com/).

Winter time is not a reason to not do sports: skiing (both downhill and cross-country), skating and
[long-distance lake skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_skating) are popular choices. There's a winter school
break when all the families go skiing at the same time and all the surrounding skiing resorts are booked long in
advance and the prices are higher. Good to know whether you have kids or not.

## Klarna's benefits

Apart from the stuff that is publicly mentioned everywhere like a mobile phone and a laptop you get
[Safari Books](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/) subscription which has a huge collection of books and courses.

## Weather

If you're moving from a place with bad climate like my hometown, Stockholm could actually be an upgrade. It gets

## Quality of life

### Cashless society

During my two and a half years in Sweden, I've dealt with cash twice: once shortly after moving when I wanted to buy a
used bike and didn't have a Swedish bank account. And another time I wanted to buy some cantarelles from a street stand
and the seller didn't accept mobile payments for some strange reason. I don't really know how swedish cash looks and
normally don't have any on me.

Merchants normally accept international cards like MasterCard and VISA. Most take cash but prefer cards.
Some refuse taking cash at all. Wireless payments are still emerging and their adoption is rather low, so tough
luck trying to use your Apple Pay. Street markets, food trucks, flea markets - everyone takes cards or, sometimes,
mobile peer-to-peer payments like Swish.

Online merchants normally offer invoice, card and part payments options via one of the payment companies. Some will
have more payment methods but those three are pretty standard. Back in Russia, cash (or card) on courier delivery is
a very popular payment choice, in Sweden it doesn't really exist.

### Electronic everything

* Taxes
* Address registration
* Bank applications
* Utility bills

### Public transport

* SL
* Ridiculous Arlanda passage fee
* Flygbussar
* Boats
* Bikes

### Post

Post is somewhat of a surprising thing to mention when it comes to the quality of life, it is one of those things
you normally don't pay attention to when it works. Well, it doesn't work in Russia where it's not uncommon for the
packages to be lost or to take forever to be delivered, usually by the time you get  a package, you no longer remember
what you've ordered. In Stockholm the post on average works really well. The postal service receives a lot of
criticism these days.

### Food

#### Eating out

One of the gems of the Swedish eating out scene is the lunch time offerings.

#### Eating in

* Good quality diery products but lack of diversity
* Mostly tasteless and smell-less fruit and vegetables. An exception is local strawberries and apples, those are
  delicious but highly seasonal.
* Decent selection of steak meet
* No real butcher shops, everything pre-cut and only a subset of the carcass.

## Housing

Housing is by far the saddest part about being an expat in Stockholm. Actually, event the locals consider the situation
to be rather unhealthy. Note that my spouse and I are urban human beings so all of the experience I have to offer has
to do with apartments and not houses. The situation is also somewhat different for students.
Let's dig in!

### Rent

Apartment rental market in Stockholm is highly regulated which is also arguably the reason why it's so broken. Most of
the rental offerings can be categorized into:

#### First-hand rent

There's quite a bit of a queue for the first-hand rent from one of the bigger landlords, or to put it less politely,
the queue is batshit crazy long:

> Most people who get an apartment have a queue time of between 7 and 11 years,
> but it can go quicker or slower than this.

according to the Stockholm Housing Agency. By "slower than this" they mean up to two or three decades in popular
spots. Staying in the queue has a symbolic annual fee.
The Housing Agency's [official website](https://bostad.stockholm.se/english/) is the place to read up more.

#### Second-hand rent

That's basically renting from someone who has a first-hand contract. It is a realistic option for a newcomer, there are
usually some offers. Because of the imbalance between demand and supply, it's very much a landlord's market (by landlord
here I mean the owner of the first-hand lease). It means that your job as the apartment seeker is to find the offer,
make sure you fulfill their arbitrary requirements on the behavior, habits, and the size and shape of the family.
Then contact the owner and persuade them that you are _the_ person to rent to. Note that you will likely be competing
with dozens or even hundreds of other candidates so reaction time is of the essence.
There's a pre-defined set of reasons allowing the owners of the first-hand contracts to sublet their apartments,
most common ones are: work or study abroad and moving in with a partner. It's the responsibility of the first-hard
contract holder to obtain a permission from the actual landlord who owns the apartment. Such permissions are time-bound
and are normally issued for a year with low probability of extension.

#### Renting an apartment from an owner

TODO: BRF vs privately owned.

#### General advice on apartment rental

* Verbal agreement is binding in Sweden but you always must have a written contract for rent,
  for your own sake. There are templates on Blocket and Bostaddirekt that you can use.
* Make sure the landlord has all the necessary papers in place.
* Do not pay any money until you have the keys.
* Do not take apartment search lightly, it is challenging and may take month(s) depending on
  your requirements and abilities.
* Stockholm is small, if something looks very far away on the map, it's still likely in the half and hour to one hour
  proximity by public transport.
* If it sounds too good to be true, it's likely fraud.
