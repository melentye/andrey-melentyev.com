Summary: About the blog and its author

Hi! My name is Andrey and you have just found my personal website. I write mostly about software development but don't mind
an occasional rant about any other area I know nothing about.

I work as a software engineer in an R&D team at a bank in Stockholm, Sweden. Our team is busy making sense of the web in
order to automate some of its boring parts. I'm also the domain architect for the AI & Automation domain to which the team
belongs. Should you be interested more in my work life, check out my [resume]({static}/static/resume.html).

Apart from work, I spend a lot of time with my better half [Elvira](https://elvira-breaking-things.tumblr.com/), exploring
parts of Stockholm and its surroundings or visiting neighbouring EU countries.

Have questions or comments about the blog? Or maybe you are a non-profit looking for a software engineer volunteer?
