Summary: About the blog and its author

Hi! My name is Andrey and you have just found my personal website. I write mostly about software development but don't mind
an occasional rant about any other area I know nothing about.

I work as a Software Engineer for a Private Equity company EQT in Stockholm, Sweden (opinions are my own).
Our team is building [Motherbrain](https://www.eqtgroup.com/digital/motherbrain/) - a product helping investment professionals
make data-driven decisions.

Apart from work, I spend a lot of time with my better half [Elvira](https://elvira-breaking-things.tumblr.com/), exploring
parts of Stockholm and its surroundings or visiting neighbouring EU countries.

Photography is a new hobby of mine, I enjoy walking around with a camera, taking less-than-average looking pictures and then
spending disproportional amounts of time developing them using opensource tools.

Have questions or comments about the blog? Or maybe you are a non-profit looking for a software engineer volunteer?
