    <h2>Blog</h2>
    <p>I hope to make the blog useful to other software engineers who work in the machine learning area. The content will
        be a mix of the emerging best practices and my own thoughts on how to engineer ML products and shape ML
        infrastructure for rapid development of new products.</p>
    <p>Disclaimer: I am not necessarily an expert in many things I will blog about, rather a learner hoping to get better
        by writing.</p>
    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>I currently work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a> where I develop distributed
        systems for realtime credit risk assessment and fraud detection. In our team we mostly use Java, Scala, plenty
        of Kafka and some Hadoop-y stuff, we continuously deliver our containerized apps to AWS. Well, technically it's not us but Jenkins
        who does the hard work but we like to be involved. Credit risk and fraud are some of those areas where even the best
        hand-crafted rules are no longer competitive and machine learning capabilities are vital. This is where I
        started working with teams of data scientists and became interested in the engineering aspects of their work.</p>
    <p>Before that I worked as a consultant for Deutsche Bank, concretely on their reference data services in the area
        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_action">Corporate Action Event</a> processing. That was a Java EE
        shop with all sorts of enterprisy things like Weblogic clusters, SOAP over JMS, ESB, BPM, tons of
        documentation and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Group_Architecture_Framework">TOGAF</a> practices.</p>
    <p>And before that I was assigned to a project for T-Mobile Germany where we made a portal for managing mobile phone
        customer subscription settings. That was my first job starting in 2008 where I learned a lot about using Java for
        real projects. That was where I saw the most SOAP services, echoes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameworx#Information_Framework">NGOSS</a>!</p>
    <p>Between T-Mobile and Deutsche Bank projects I helped out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exigen_Services">Exigen Services</a>,
        the consultancy firm I was employed at, with some pre-sale activities, mostly in the insurance domain. I even
        got to work with SAP stack for a short while and wrote a few lines of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP#.22Hello_World.22">ABAP</a> code.</p>
    <p>Apart from work I spend a lot of time with my better half Elvira, exploring parts of Stockholm and it's surroundings
        or visiting neighboring EU countries.</p>
    <p>There's usually an online course or two I am taking to keep up-to-date with ML and SWE stuff, consider me a
        believer in the lifelong education. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>,
        <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, Stanford lectures on
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6">NLP</a>
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv">CV</a>, and now
        <a href="http://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>, keep 'em coming! I enjoy learning new programming languages
        too and looking for an opportunity to <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">learn myself some more Haskell for a great good</a>.
        <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> has it's nice sides, I also like Erlang, Scala and Python and would use them
        depending on the task.</p>
    <p>Have questions or comments about the blog? Or maybe you are a non-profit looking to do some data engineering?</p>
